# Nathanparchment.com v.03

This is the third iteration of my portfolio. Using react-dom-router, I have created a site that runs smoothly with greater response time compared to my other portfolios.

#### What I learnt
- I have never used Tailwind CSS before but it has made styling much easier and quicker with simple implementation and ease of use.
- Using Framer motion hooks was a big help as it gave me an opportunity to choose how I want my animation, without coding much and being simple to understand.
- Catering towards accessibility more than other projects and want my portfolio to be easier to use for all users.

## Improvements for future features
- Burger menu icon on smaller devices doesnâ€™t read and when clicked sometimes goes to homepage instead of menu.

## Deployment
